# Exercise 2: Running containers

In this exercise, we'll learn how to modify an existing Docker image, and commit it as a new one.


### Why

### Modifying an image

To run containers, we'll first need to pull some images.

1. Let's see what images we have currently on our machine, by running `docker images`:

    ```
    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    ```
